WordNet
WordNetÂ® are Nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs grouped into cognitive synonyms (synsets), each expressing a distinct concept.
WordNet's structure is helpful for computational linguistics and natural language processing.
WordNet superficially resembles a thesaurus, which groups words based on their meanings. However, there are some crucial distinctions.
WordNet interlinks are specific senses of words. So, words found close to one another in the network are semantically disambiguated.
WordNet finds the semantic relations among words, whereas the groupings of words in a thesaurus do not follow any exact pattern other than meaning similarity.
The most often encoded relation among synsets is the super-subordinate relation. This is because all noun hierarchies ultimately go up the root node.
Hyponymy relation is transitive; WordNet differentiates among Types and Instances.
Meronymy, the part-whole relation holds between synsets. This is because parts are inherited from their superordinates.
